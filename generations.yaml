generations:
  - name: "First Generation (SA/FB)"
    start_year: 1978
    end_year: 1985
    description: "The original RX-7 established Mazda's rotary-powered sports car legacy with its lightweight, compact design and distinctive front-midship engine placement. Powered by a 12A twin-rotor Wankel engine (later available with fuel injection) producing approximately 100-135 horsepower depending on market and specification, paired with either a four-speed or five-speed manual transmission or optional three-speed automatic. The sleek, elongated hood design was necessitated by the front-midship layout, which placed the compact rotary engine behind the front axle for near-perfect weight distribution. The chassis featured MacPherson strut front and semi-trailing arm rear suspension, disc brakes up front, and a curb weight under 2,500 pounds. Initially available only as a two-seat coupe, limited-production convertible and 2+2 'GLX' variants were later added. Significant updates included the Series 2 (1981) and Series 3 (1984) refreshes, bringing redesigned bumpers, interior improvements, and enhanced performance through fuel injection on GSL-SE models. The first-generation RX-7 achieved both commercial and motorsport success, winning over 100 IMSA races and establishing itself as an affordable, distinctive alternative to conventional sports cars with over 470,000 units sold worldwide."

  - name: "Second Generation (FC)"
    start_year: 1986
    end_year: 1992
    description: "The second-generation RX-7 evolved from a lightweight sports car to a more sophisticated grand tourer, taking styling inspiration from the Porsche 944 with pop-up headlights, wider proportions, and a more substantial presence. Initially powered by a naturally aspirated 13B rotary engine producing 146 horsepower, the lineup expanded in 1987 to include a turbocharged variant generating 182 horsepower (later increased to 200 hp in Series 5 models). The chassis featured sophisticated independent suspension all around, with dynamic tracking suspension technology that provided passive rear-wheel steering. Available in naturally aspirated, turbocharged, and convertible body styles (the latter introduced in 1988), it offered more variety than its predecessor. Interior quality and features improved significantly, with available leather upholstery, power accessories, and advanced audio systems. Performance and handling were enhanced through five distinct series updates throughout production, with the most significant being the Series 4 (1989) and Series 5 (1990) updates in the US market, bringing revised suspension tuning, improved turbos, and cosmetic refinements. Special editions included the GTU for the naturally aspirated models and anniversary editions to celebrate Mazda's rotary heritage. The second-generation RX-7 continued Mazda's motorsport success, competing successfully in IMSA GTO and GTU classes, and established itself as a more premium sports car while maintaining the unique character of the rotary engine."

  - name: "Third Generation (FD)"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The third-generation RX-7 represented the pinnacle of Mazda's rotary-powered sports car development, featuring striking organic styling with a curvaceous body virtually devoid of straight lines. Powered by a sequentially twin-turbocharged 13B-REW rotary engine producing 255 horsepower in the U.S. market (effortless power delivery came from its innovative sequential turbocharging system, with the primary turbo providing boost at lower RPMs before seamlessly transitioning to both turbos at higher engine speeds. Internationally, power outputs ranged up to 280 hp in the Japanese market. Paired with a five-speed manual transmission (later a Spirit R exclusive six-speed) or optional four-speed automatic. The chassis featured double-wishbone suspension front and rear, powerful four-wheel disc brakes, and a near-perfect 50:50 weight distribution achieved through the front-midship engine layout. Weighing approximately 2,800 pounds, it achieved exceptional handling balance and was widely regarded as one of the best-handling sports cars of its era. The driver-focused interior featured wraparound cockpit design, supportive seats, and minimal luxury appointments in keeping with its focused sporting intent. Various special editions throughout its production included the lightweight RS models for the Japanese market, the track-oriented R1/R2 in North America, and the final Spirit R models that marked the end of production with enhanced performance and exclusive features. While the third-generation RX-7 was discontinued in most international markets by 1995/1996 due to emissions regulations and economic factors, production continued for the Japanese domestic market until 2002. Limited production numbers (particularly in markets outside Japan) and exceptional performance have made the FD RX-7 a highly sought-after modern classic, representing the most focused and uncompromising expression of Mazda's rotary sports car philosophy."
